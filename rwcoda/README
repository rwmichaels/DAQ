Example to read a CODA file.  Oh, and for writing one you
can use evWrite instead of evRead.  rwcoda_split.c is an
example of that -- it splits CODA files.

The code is rwcoda.c

to compile type "make"

to run

./rwcoda /home/compton/data/raw/run1121.dat 50

where the 1st arg is the file and the 2nd arg is the number of events.
