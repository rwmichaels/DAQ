    HRS SCALER ANALYSIS 
    ====================

 This file :  ~adaq/$EXPERIMENT/scaler/README
 R. Michaels,  Updated Mar 2005

 This involves the scalers from L-arm and R-arm HRS.
 It is not necessarily applicable to the TS2 scalers (SRC Trig. Super.)
 You can do the following operations on adaql4 :

 1. STRIP CHART(s)
 ================

  The strip chart is a macro to show scalers and ratios of scalers.
  The data are obtained online directly from VME.  
  You can invoke the strip chart software from the ROOT prompt 
  as follows

       root   .x   strip.C

  and don't forget the dot(.) before the x

  The X axis is the time in seconds since the chart was started.


 2. XSCALER DISPLAY  (including chart graphs)
 ==================

     "./xscaler Left"  or  "./xscaler Right"
                       or  "./xscaler DVCS_CALO"
   don't forget the dot (.) and slash (/)

   will start the xscaler on Left or Right HRS
   scalers respectively.  

   This is the ROOT/C++/Linux version of xscaler 
  (not to be confused with the old Motif/C/SunOS version)

   Clicking on a button corresponding to a channel will
   pop up a history graph.  If you want to monitor the
   target thickness you need to go to the "norm" page
   (for normalization scaler) and press "trigger-1" or
   "trigger-3" to monitor the history.  You need to
   press the button to update the chart.  Note, the trigger
   is not normalized the the beam current.  But this is
   handled better by the strip chart (see #1.).  


 3. NTUPLE OF SCALERS for 1 run
 ===============================

   "./tscalntup /adaql2/data2/e01015_1417.dat.0 Right"
   don't forget the dot (.) and slash (/)

   This will analyze run 1417 (you must give the full
   path name) and the Right HRS scalers.  Can also say
   "Left" in the last argument, for Left HRS scalers.

   This produces a root file "scaler.root" with a
   TNtuple "ascal".  You can do stuff like this:

   To start root and open scaler.root file:   
       root scaler.root

   To check the contents of the ntuple (at the root prompt).
      root [0] ascal->Print()

   To plot trigger 1 versus time:
       ascal->Draw("t1:time")

   Other stuff at the root prompt -- try it:
      .x beam.macro
      .x trigger.macro
   don't forget the dot(.) before the x   


  4. HISTORY OF RECENT RUNS
  =========================

   ./tscalhist     

    don't forget the dot(.) and the slash (/)
    
    After typing this, answer the obvious questions, example:

    ./tscalhist
    Enter bank 'Right' or 'Left' (spectrometer) ->
    Left
    enter [runlo, runhi] = interval of runs to summarize ->
    runlo: 
    1417
    runhi: 
    1420

   Will get a printout of runs 1417 - 1420.
   This also fills an ntuple, in scalerhist.root

  5. QASY -- charge asymmetry
  ===========================

      Not in this directory; go to ~adaq/qasy and
      see the README file there.


  6. WHERE IS THE CODE ???
  =========================

      Scaler Code is in ./hana_scaler
      Strip chart macro in ./stripchart

      For the scaler code you can "make xscaler" or "make tscalntup" 
      or "make tscalhist".  to make the above codes.
      Relevant sources are tscalgui_main.C, tscalntup_main.C
      and tscalhist_main.C

      Make sure to control the Init() method.  With no argument
      the default is now.  Otherwise it picks out a certain date
      in the scaler.map file, according to the rules (picks the
      map of the latest date before the specified date).

      For more info about scaler code see ./hana_scaler/README
      For more info about the strip chart see ./stripchart/README
