  Strip Chart for Scalers
  =======================

  R. Michaels    Jan 2004

  The strip chart is a macro to show scalers and ratios of scalers.
  The data are obtained online directly from VME.
  You can invoke the strip chart software from the ROOT prompt 
  as follows

     root   .x   strip.C

  and don't forget the dot(.) before the x

  It is required to have the following shared object files
  which are part of the analyzer package.

     libdc.so
     libscaler.so

  One also needs the scaler.map file, as usual.
 
     scaler.map

  The macro is contained in these files (header and implementation):

     strip.h
     strip.C
